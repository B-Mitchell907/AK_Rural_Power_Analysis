*Disclaimer:* 
The purpose of this calculator is to show relative cost and performance differences between Wind, Solar, and Diesel power. 
This program does not guarantee the default estimations produced for each city. The default size of a Wind/Solar installation 
is determined by calculating the size required to produce 30% of the total energy (kWh) used in the city for an entire year. 
Power Cost Equalization (PCE) is a state government program to reduce the cost of electricity in Rural Alaska.  
The amount of PCE assistance was used as an indicator of how costly energy projects are in a community. It was used to adjust
 the default estimation of wind and solar construction costs. Construction costs for past wind and solar projects and recent 
 cost trends were also considered.
