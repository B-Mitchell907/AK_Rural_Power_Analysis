*Disclaimer About Calculator:* 
This program does not garuntee the default estimations and approximation about each city/village is 
correct.
The purpose of the calculator is show relative cost difference based of the existing Diesel energy 
cost and estimations of cost for the installation of Wind or Solar energy. 
The default settings for the size of a Wind/Solar installation is determined by size needed to produce
30% of total power (kWh) used in the city/village for a entire year.
In actual application for Wind energy installation in rural scenarios, the median for energy produced by
wind was near 30% of total, however for Solar cases the actual precentage of energy production is 
much lower.
The approximation for a project Capital Expenditure is calculated from the Power Cost Equalizer (PCE) rate
for each city/village.
In was discovered in analyzing past projects that the PCE rate correlates well 
with general cost of constrcution, shipping, and remoteness from a larger hub city/village.
Thus, the driving factor for estimating cost in this calculator.
Note, older Wind and Solar projects were done before techonolgy prices could have become less expensive, 
these project cost were still taken in account.
