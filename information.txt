*Disclaimer:* 
This program does not guarantee the default estimations and approximation about each city is 
correct.
The purpose of the calculator is to show relative cost difference based on the existing Diesel energy 
cost and estimations of charge for the installation of Wind or Solar power. 
The default settings for the size of a Wind/Solar installation is defined by calculating the size 
required to produce 30% of total power (kWh) used in the city for an entire year.
In an actual application for Wind energy installation in rural scenarios, the median for energy
produced by the wind was near 30% of the total. However, for Solar cases, the actual percentage of
energy production is much lower.
The approximation for a project Capital Expenditure is calculated from the Power Cost Equalizer (PCE)
rate for each city.
It was found in analyzing past projects that the PCE rate correlates well 
with the general cost of construction, shipping, and remoteness from a larger hub city/village.
Thus, the driving factor for estimating the cost in this calculator.
Note; past Wind and Solar projects were done before technology prices could have become less expensive; 
these project cost were still taken into account.
